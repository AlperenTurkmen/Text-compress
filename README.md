# Text-compress
ECM1414 Continuous Assessment 2021
This masterpiece compresses a file using the Huffman coding, saves the huffman tree to a json file, 
then also decompresses a compressed file using that huffman tree from dictionary.json. Using the same method. 
At first, you can ignore the dictionary.json as the program will create or overwrite it automatically.
How to use it:
STEP 1: To make it work, you should put the txt file in the same directory as the huffman.py file.
STEP 2: Then, you should go to terminal, go into that directory using "cd" and "ls" commands. 
STEP 3: You should run the code: python huffman.py <txt_file_to_be_compressed> <bin_file_to_store_compressed_file>
This step will compress your file into a bin file you desire. Note: files should be in types of: .txt and .bin respectively.
To test this program, you can download some data from the following links:
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/22367/pg22367.txt Metamorphosis-Franz Kafka in German
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5200/pg5200.txt Metamorphosis-Franz Kafka in English
I couldn't find any other languages in this website, so I decided to include Metamorphosis-Franz Kafka in Turkish within the directory.
donusum.txt is Metamorphosis in Turkish.

But if you want, you can try. Most likely will take a lot of your precious time.)
