This masterpiece compresses a file using the Huffman coding, then also decompresses a compressed file. Using the same method. 
How to use it:
STEP 1: To make it work, you should put the txt file in the same directory as the huffman.py file.
STEP 2: Then, you should go to terminal, go into that directory using "cd" and "ls" commands. 
STEP 3: You should run the code: python huffman.py <txt_file_to_be_compressed> 
This step will compress your file into another txt

But if you want, you can try. Most likely will take a lot of your precious time.)
